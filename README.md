### 👩‍💻 About Me:

- 📚 I am currently a Software Engineering graduate from Carleton university! 

- 👀 I’m interested in designing and creating tools, applications and solutions that I can use in my daily life or that can help others! Whether it's for games, school, work, or fun projects. At the same time, a large passion of mine is to start and learn as I complete projects. I love uncovering new and cool ways to simplify and write effecient code that will help better my code readability and my programming skills! 

- :speech_balloon: I hope to collaborate with other aspiring desiners/developers to create fascinating applications and solutions. I’m opened to meeting new people and discussing about ideas and ways to better my programming skills or assist in any way I can!
